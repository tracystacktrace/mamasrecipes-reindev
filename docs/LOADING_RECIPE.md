## How can I test my recipe or load it in game?

As for `0.1` version, the only way you can load your recipe `.json` files is by putting them in the `mamasrecipes` folder:

```
<minecraft folder>/config/mamasrecipes/
```

Put there your `.json` files and the game will detect and load them.

### Extra info

In the future, I might add support via `.zip` packages, load recipes from mods' resources, etc.
